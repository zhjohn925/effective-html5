--The first is the web site http://caniuse.com, which provides a comprehensive analysis of which
versions of which browsers support HTML5 and CSS3 features. Detailed information is available on a
wide range of desktop and mobile browsers on a range of operating systems. Also, there are some simple
decision-support tools that are tied to browser popularity and market penetration. I find this web site
very useful when starting a new project to get a feel for which features I can reasonably rely on. It makes
tracking the fragmented standard process and browser implementation reasonably simple.

--The second tool is Modernizr (www.modernizr.com), which tests for individual features dynamically. It
takes the form of a small JavaScript library that tests for the presence of key HTML5 and CSS features,
allowing you to adapt to the features that the user’s browser supports. It also has some other nice
features, such as enabling the styling of the new HTML5 semantic elements (described in Chapter 10) in
older versions of Internet Explorer.

--Enhancing CSS with LESS
When you start working with CSS, you will quickly realize that it is a verbose and repetitive way of
expressing styles. There is a lot of duplication, which can make long-term maintenance of your styles
time consuming and error prone.
You can extend CSS using LESS, which uses JavaScript to enhance CSS. It supports some nice
features, such as variables, inheritance from one style to another, and functions. I have been using LESS
a lot lately, and I have been pleased with the results. You can get details and download the JavaScript
library at http://lesscss.org.


--Using a CSS Framework
A number of high-quality CSS frameworks are available that you can use as the foundation for web sites
and web applications. These frameworks contain sets of styles, which mean you don’t have to reinvent
the wheel. The better frameworks also smooth out the differences in implementation between browsers.
The CSS framework that I recommend is Blueprint, which is available for download at
www.blueprintcss.org. It is simple to use and very flexible, and it has an excellent system for creating
grid layouts.
