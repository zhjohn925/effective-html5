The order of Styles Cascade is very specific:
  1. Inline styles (styles that are defined using the style global 
     attribute on an element)
  2. Embedded styles (styles that are defined in a style element)
  3. External styles (styles that are imported using the link element)
  4. User styles (styles that have been defined by the user)
  5. Browser styles (the default styles applied by the browser)

The order of Styles Cascade to an element defined at the same level:
  1. The number of id values in the styleâ€™s selector
  2. The number of other attributes and pseudo-classes in the selector
  3. The number of element names and pseudo-elements in the selector

Tweaking the order with Important Styles
  ie.  color: black !important;
The browser gives perference to important styles, regardless of 
  where they are defined.
